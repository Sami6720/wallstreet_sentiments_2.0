# Wall Street Sentiments 2.0
## Overview
Repo for a web dashboard that monitors Reddit users' sentiments about the most popular stocks on the platform. This web app is under construction and is actively being built.
## Future Plans
1. The ability to click on the stocks and be routed to more details about them.
2. The ability to select certain stocks and keep track of them (search and add).
3. Create the pipeline for data collection to train a model that predicts the direction of the price of stocks based on sentiment analysis and fundamental indicators. This will be implemented with inspiration from the previous version of the project.
